    <h2>Pendulum</h2>
    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

    <div class="accordion">I don't want to have to log every letter as both <strong>written</strong> and <strong>sent</strong>. Can I skip that?</div>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Absolutely! You can simply not log any items as <strong>sent</strong> and only use the <strong>written</strong> events, but to avoid Pendulum constantly reminding you that you have items to post, you can toggle "Track posting letters" to <strong>off</strong> in the Settings tab.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion">How do I mark a received item as something I do not need to respond to?</div>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Once you've logged an item as received, tap on the event in the correspondence history, and switch the "No responses needed" toggle to <strong>on</strong>. You will no longer be prompted to respond to the item.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion">What does "No response needed" mean?</div>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>When you log some correspondence (such as sending or receiving a letter), you can mark the event as "no response needed". This means Pendulum won't use this event when determining the state of the Pen Pal. For example, a received postcard marked as "no response needed" won't prompt or remind you to reply to it; and a sent parcel won't sit in the "you're waiting for a reply!" section indefinitely.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion">How do I delete a Pen Pal?</div>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>From the main list of Pen Pals, you can swipe a Pen Pal to the left and tap the trash can icon to delete it. You will be prompted for confirmation, but be careful - this is irreversible!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion">What does archiving a Pen Pal mean?</div>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>When you archive a Pen Pal, they move to a section at the bottom of the Pen Pals list, and you won't be prompted to write back or be constantly waiting for a reply. You won't lose the history of your correspondence.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion">How do I add an address to a Pen Pal?</div>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>If you have Contacts integration <strong>enabled</strong> (a toggle in the Settings tab, which is on by default), Pendulum will pull your Pen Pal's address information from Contacts. To update this info, use the Contacts app,</p>
      <p>If you have Contacts integration <strong>disabled</strong>, there is currently no way to add address information to a Pen Pal. Consider adding your Pen Pals to your Contacts address bookâ€”perhaps under a new group to keep them separate.</p>
