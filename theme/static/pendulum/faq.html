    <h2>Pendulum</h2>
    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

    <div class="accordion">I don't want to have to log every letter as both <strong>written</strong> and <strong>sent</strong>. Can I skip that?</div>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Absolutely! You can simply not log any items as <strong>sent</strong> and only use the <strong>written</strong> events, but to avoid Pendulum constantly reminding you that you have items to post, you can toggle "Track posting letters" to <strong>off</strong> in the Settings tab.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion">How do I mark a received item as something I do not need to respond to?</div>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Once you've logged an item as received, tap on the event in the correspondence history, and switch the "No responses needed" toggle to <strong>on</strong>. You will no longer be prompted to respond to the item.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion">What does "No response needed" mean?</div>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>When you log some correspondence (such as sending or receiving a letter), you can mark the event as "no response needed". This means Pendulum won't use this event when determining the state of the Pen Pal. For example, a received postcard marked as "no response needed" won't prompt or remind you to reply to it; and a sent parcel won't sit in the "you're waiting for a reply!" section indefinitely.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion">How do I delete a Pen Pal?</div>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>From the main list of Pen Pals, you can press and hold on a Pen Pal to bring up a menu of options. Tap "Delete" to permanently delete the Pen Pal. You will be prompted for confirmation, but be careful - this is irreversible!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion">What does archiving a Pen Pal mean?</div>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>When you archive a Pen Pal, they move to a section at the bottom of the Pen Pals list, and you won't be prompted to write back or be constantly waiting for a reply. You won't lose the history of your correspondence.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion">How do I add an address to a Pen Pal?</div>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>If you have Contacts integration <strong>enabled</strong> (a toggle in the Settings tab, which is on by default), Pendulum will pull your Pen Pal's address information from Contacts. To update this info, use the Contacts app,</p>
      <p>If you have Contacts integration <strong>disabled</strong>, you can add an address to your Pen Pal by tapping the user icon on the top right of the Pen Pal screen. This feature is new in version 1.15.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion">Can I export my data?</div>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>From the <strong>Backup and Restore</strong> section of <strong>Settings</strong>, you can generate and export a backup of your data that you can later re-import into the app. Pendulum will keep the most recent archive you generate, but you can (and are encouraged to) save it elsewhere for safe keeping.</p>
      <p>Pendulum will have generated an initial archive when you first launched version 1.10.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion">How do I restore from a backup?</div>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>From the <strong>Backup and Restore</strong> section of <strong>Settings</strong>, you can choose to restore from a backup archive—either the one Pendulum is storing locally for you, or one you have saved elsewhere in Files.</p>
      <p>When restoring, Pendulum will add any new Pen Pals, logged events, photos, and stationery items into the database that exist in the backup. If a Pen Pal or event already exists, Pendulum will either overwrite its data with the one from the backup archive, or keep the one in the database, depending on whether you have <strong>Overwrite Duplicates</strong> toggled or not.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="accordion">Pendulum is using too much storage space.</div>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>You can free up storage by deleting the in-app backup archive that Pendulum is storing, if there is one. You can do this from the <strong>Backup and Restore</strong> section of <strong>Settings</strong>, by swiping left on the backup archive's name.</p>
