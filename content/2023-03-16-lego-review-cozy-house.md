I love LEGO's Creator 3-in-1 range, where every set can be built into three different designs. [31139](https://brickset.com/sets/31139-1) Cozy House is no exception, with three excellent builds, and a handful of adorable little bugs to boot!

> The primary model of the set is the titular Cozy House (or "cosy", as we'd be more likely to write here in the UK). It's a fantastic little two-story building with pitched roofs, a delightful garden, and is full of excellent details!
