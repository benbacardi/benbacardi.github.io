LEGO have announced the results of the latest [IDEAS](https://ideas.lego.com/) review (the mechanism by which fan-designed models can get made into real LEGO sets, should they reach 10,000 votes and pass the review). Four projects were accepted this time, and I particularly like the look of the Space Age designs, which will hopefully be an instant buy when it eventually comes out some time in 2023/2024. The other three ideas also look fantastic, and it will be interesting to see how LEGO adapts them to become production-ready sets. I hope they include [Chris McVeigh](https://chrismcveigh.com/cm/welcome.html) on the team designing the Polaroid, as that is right up his alley!
