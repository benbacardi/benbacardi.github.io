Once again LEGO are coming up with some very creative 3-in-1 sets for their first wave of 2024:

> I'm a big fan of the 3-in-1 range. Lately LEGO have been knocking it out of the park with so many of these sets, and this one held great promise. I love the colour scheme, and the roller skate is a brilliant build. It's a decent size, feels solid in the hand, and although it's not a vehicle, pushing it around is quite satisfying. It's just a shame there's only oneâ€”a pair would have been fantastic!
