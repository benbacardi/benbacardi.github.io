I took look at [another one](https://brickset.com/article/79600/review-71407-cat-peach-suit-and-frozen-tower) of the Princess Peach-themed Super Mario LEGO sets that were released at the start of August:

> There's no doubt that this set is visually striking - it has an impressive height, bright colours, and a baddie flying around on a broomstick. It's also great to see a costume change for Peach introduced already (and I'm glad that the other characters can use it tooâ€”although Luigi did need a software update in order to understand).

One more to go in this batch of reviews!
