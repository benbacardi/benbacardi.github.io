It's that time of the year again (where on earth has 2025 gone?!) where Brickset publish their annual holiday gift guide, in five parts split by price category. Along with the other Brickset contributors, I provided my opinion, and there's a nice diverse range of sets across the price ranges! You can view each of the articles below, along with my pick from the available choices:
