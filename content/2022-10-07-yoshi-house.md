I was given a few more of the LEGO [Super Mario](https://brickset.com/news/category-Set-review/theme-Super-Mario) sets to review for Brickset, including [71407](https://brickset.com/article/82124/review-71406-yoshi-s-gift-house) Yoshi's Gift House:

> Since I was a child, Yoshi has always been my favourite Super Mario character. I couldn't put my finger on why, but there's something very whimsical and fun about the dinosaur-like cartoon creature that's willing to carry Mario around on his back and help out wherever he can.
>
> He's an iconic part of Mario lore, and has fittingly appeared in a number of sets so far in the Super Mario line. [71406](https://brickset.com/sets/71406-1) Yoshi's Gift House is the latest to feature the character, and is the largest with him as the sole protagonist.
