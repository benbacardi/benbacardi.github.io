I've quite liked the previous sets in the LEGO Postcard series, so it was good to get a chance to review the latest, [40651](https://brickset.com/sets/40651-1) Australia, even if it's a [slight departure from the rest](https://brickset.com/article/88236/review-40651-australia-postcard):

> The designers have chosen to represent the entirety of Australia with a small shack, a windpump, an outdoor toilet, a large tree with a cockatoo, and a sign warning of kangaroos. There's also a Qantas plane flying through the bright blue sky, and small colourful plants growing around the ground.
