The latest batch of LEGO I've been provided to review included three City Stuntz sets, a range that I've not built or played with before. They come with flywheel-powered bikes and stunt arenas, and are all pretty creative and fun! The first review went up today, for [60359](https://brickset.com/article/92281/review-60359-dunk-stunt-ramp-challenge) Dunk Stunt Ramp Challenge:

> Despite the theme entering its third year, this was my first experience of the line, and I was quite impressed! The flywheel-powered bike is a lot of fun, and it kept both my children (aged four and six) entertained for some considerable time (once they stopped fighting over whose turn it was).
