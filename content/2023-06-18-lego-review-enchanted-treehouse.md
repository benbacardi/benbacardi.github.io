My latest LEGO review is up on [Brickset](https://brickset.com/article/97503/review-43215-the-enchanted-treehouse), of the Disney 100 Enchanted Treehouse.

> The star of the set is clearly the impressive selection of minidolls. Their shape definitely suits the Disney Princesses more than a minifigure would; it is just a shame their articulation is significantly less.
> 
> The two halves of the treehouse look fantastic together, and there's plenty of play value with the slide, stairs, zip wire, canoe, and various other smaller builds and interactive sections. It looks good both on display and during play.
