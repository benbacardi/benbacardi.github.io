LEGO's got some really strong Creator 3-in-1 sets out this year, and [31154 Forest Animals: Red Fox](https://brickset.com/sets/31154-1) is one of the best. You can build a fox, an owl, or a squirrel, and all three models are truly excellent.

>  [31154](https://brickset.com/sets/31154-1) Forest Animals: Red Fox doesn't disappoint; all three models are fantastic, were a joy to build, and look great on display. Each manages to capture the unique characteristics of the woodland creatures, and the articulation makes them quite satisfying to pose in the way that you want.
