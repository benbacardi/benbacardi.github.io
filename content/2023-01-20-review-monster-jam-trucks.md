Recently, two more reviews of mine went up on Brickset: one for [42149 Monster Jam Dragon](https://brickset.com/article/88534/review-42149-monster-jam-dragon) and the other for its counterpart, [42150 Monster Jam Monster Mutt Dalmation](https://brickset.com/article/88535/review-42150-monster-jam-monster-mutt-dalmation). They're part of a small series that LEGO has released over the past few years, with two pull-back-and-go Technic monster trucks from the [Monster Jam](https://www.monsterjam.com) sport. Spoilers for the reviews, but I think they're great little "intro to Technic" sets, and you can't go wrong at less than Â£18.
