They're part of a small series that LEGO has released over the past few years, with two pull-back-and-go Technic monster trucks from the &lt;a href="https://www.monsterjam.com"&gt;Monster Jam&lt;/a&gt; sport. Spoilers for the reviews, but I think they're great little "intro to Technic" sets, and you can't go wrong at less than £18.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The designers have chosen to represent the entirety of Australia with a small shack, a windpump, an outdoor toilet, a large tree with a cockatoo, and a sign warning of kangaroos. There's also a Qantas plane flying through the bright blue sky, and small colourful plants growing around the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I was a child, Yoshi has always been my favourite Super Mario character. I couldn't put my finger on why, but there's something very whimsical and fun about the dinosaur-like cartoon creature that's willing to carry Mario around on his back and help out wherever he can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He's an iconic part of Mario lore, and has fittingly appeared in a number of sets so far in the Super Mario line. &lt;a href="https://brickset.com/sets/71406-1"&gt;71406&lt;/a&gt; Yoshi's Gift House is the latest to feature the character, and is the largest with him as the sole protagonist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://brickset.com/sets/71408-1/Princess-Peach-s-Castle"&gt;71408&lt;/a&gt; Princess Peach's Castle is the largest of the Peach-themed additions to the Super Mario line this year, and is in fact the largest of all the game's sets so far at 1,216 parts. It includes a variety of characters, both new to the range and returning, and commands some impressive space when laid out ready to play. Let's take a look at what's inside!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's no doubt that this set is visually striking - it has an impressive height, bright colours, and a baddie flying around on a broomstick. It's also great to see a costume change for Peach introduced already (and I'm glad that the other characters can use it too—although Luigi did need a software update in order to understand).&lt;/p&gt;
