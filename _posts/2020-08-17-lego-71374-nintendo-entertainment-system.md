Beyond my budget (for now!), but the new NES LEGO set looks fantastic:

> [71374](https://brickset.com/sets/71374-1/Nintendo-Entertainment-System) Nintendo Entertainment System achieves extraordinary realism, potentially surpassing any previous LEGO model in that regard. The external detail is absolutely spectacular and the designers have made splendid use of existing elements to recreate distinctive shapes from the NES. I am particularly delighted with the controller and the casing around the connection ports on the console, both of which could be mistaken for their real equivalents.

Hopefully it will be available in the LEGO employee store when I visit Billund for the 2021 Inside Tour next year!
