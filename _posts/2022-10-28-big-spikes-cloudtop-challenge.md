The last of this round of Super Mario LEGO sets to review, [71409](https://brickset.com/sets/71409-1) Big Spike's Cloudtop Challenge:

> LEGO keep on producing Super Mario expansion sets to add to what is clearly a popular theme for themâ€”this year they have released [14 distinct sets](https://brickset.com/sets/subtheme-Expansion-Set/year-2022) in the range so far. [71409](https://brickset.com/sets/71409-1) Big Spike's Cloudtop Challenge is one of the largest, with 540 parts, and packs a decent punch: three opponents, two of which are new, and some fun takes on the interactivity and game play we've come to expect with these sets.
