Wired:

> "Nonspecialists kind of view the internet as this high-tech, gleaming thing like the bridge of the starship Enterprise. It’s not like that at all. It’s more like an 18th-century Royal Navy frigate. There’s a lot of running around and screaming and shouting and pulling on ropes to try to get things going in the right direction."
